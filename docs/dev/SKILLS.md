# lobslaw — Skills (Phase 8)

User-authored higher-level operations that live on a storage mount as directories of `manifest.yaml` + handler script. The skill registry watches the mount, the invoker dispatches to python or bash runtimes, and the sandbox machinery (Phase 4.5.5) gates filesystem + syscall reach via Landlock + seccomp.

Two packages cooperate:

- **`internal/skills`** — `Skill`, `Manifest`, `Registry`, `Invoker`.
- **`internal/storage`** — Phase 9's mount manager and watcher, consumed via `Registry.Watch` and `Invoker.storage.Resolve`.

Nothing in this package manages the filesystem or subprocess sandboxing directly — storage and sandbox are existing systems skills compose.

## Manifest shape

```yaml
# skills/agenda/manifest.yaml
name: agenda
version: 1.0.0
description: Render today's plan in a natural voice
runtime: python        # or: bash
handler: handler.py    # relative to this manifest's directory
storage:
  - label: shared
    mode: read         # default; or: write
network: []            # declared allow-list (enforcement = Phase 8 future)
params_schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    window: { type: string }
```

### Validation rules

Parse rejects manifests that violate any of:

- **Name** non-empty, no `/` or `\`. Skill names are bucket keys in the registry, not filesystem paths.
- **Version** non-empty. Parsed with `golang.org/x/mod/semver`; non-semver sorts lexicographically (tolerated, but a warn shows up in the registry log).
- **Runtime** one of `python`, `bash`. Unknown runtimes reject — better than a confusing "binary not found" at invocation.
- **Handler** resolves to a file inside the manifest directory (blocks `../` traversal in operator-authored files). The file must exist — a manifest pointing at a missing handler fails Parse, not first invocation.
- **Storage** entries: non-empty label, mode in `{read, write}` (default: read). Raw paths are never accepted — operators wire a storage mount first.

---

## Registry

`internal/skills.Registry` is name-indexed. Multiple storage mounts can expose the same skill name (e.g. `agenda` shipped by the operator's config alongside `agenda` from a plugin bundle); the registry resolves via semver-highest-wins with deterministic lexicographic tie-break on `ManifestDir`. Two replicas with identical mounts pick the same winner.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  mount["storage mount label: skills"]
  root["/srv/mnt/skills/"]
  scan["Registry.Scan(root)"]
  parse["Parse(dir)"]
  put["Registry.Put"]
  win["byName: map[name]*Skill<br/>(highest semver wins)"]
  watch["Registry.Watch via<br/>storage.Manager.Watch"]
  reload["rescan on change"]

  mount -->|Resolve| root
  root --> scan
  scan --> parse
  parse --> put
  put --> win
  root --> watch
  watch --> reload
  reload --> scan
```

`Registry.Watch(ctx, mgr, "skills")` subscribes to the mount via the storage watcher (recursive, `manifest.yaml`-filtered) and rescans on every relevant event. Full rescan is simpler than per-file surgery and cheap at realistic skill counts.

`Registry.Remove(manifestDir)` falls back to the next-highest candidate rather than dropping the name — taking a mount offline doesn't orphan a skill the cluster still has other copies of.

---

## Invoker

`internal/skills.Invoker` looks up a skill, composes argv + env, pipes JSON params on stdin, captures stdout + stderr into capped buffers, returns exit code + duration.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant Caller
  participant Inv as Invoker
  participant Reg as Registry
  participant Mgr as storage.Manager
  participant Run as SubprocessRunner
  participant SB as sandbox (future)
  participant Proc as skill subprocess

  Caller->>Inv: Invoke(skillName, params)
  Inv->>Reg: Get(skillName)
  Reg-->>Inv: *Skill
  loop per declared storage access
    Inv->>Mgr: Resolve(label)
    Mgr-->>Inv: absolute path
  end
  Inv->>Inv: buildArgv(runtime, handler)
  Inv->>Inv: buildEnv(LOBSLAW_SKILL_* + LOBSLAW_STORAGE_*)
  Inv->>Inv: marshal params → JSON
  Note over Inv,SB: sandbox.Apply(cmd, policy) wraps Run in 8-future-sandbox
  Inv->>Run: Run(ctx, argv, env, stdin, stdout, stderr)
  Run->>Proc: spawn
  Proc-->>Run: exit code + output
  Run-->>Inv: exit code
  Inv-->>Caller: InvokeResult
```

### argv by runtime

| runtime | argv |
|---|---|
| `python` | `python3 <handler-abs-path>` |
| `bash` | `bash <handler-abs-path>` |

### env conventions

The subprocess sees only what the invoker composes (not inherited `os.Environ()`):

- `LOBSLAW_SKILL_NAME` — set to the skill name so handlers can log their own identity.
- `LOBSLAW_SKILL_VERSION` — the version from the manifest.
- `LOBSLAW_STORAGE_<LABEL>` — one var per declared storage access. Label is uppercased, non-`[A-Z0-9_]` characters become `_`. Value is the resolved absolute path. Lets bash handlers do `cat "$LOBSLAW_STORAGE_SHARED/file.txt"` without re-parsing config.

### stdin

`InvokeRequest.Params` is JSON-marshalled and piped to the subprocess. Handler reads from stdin:

```python
# python
import json, sys
params = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(json.dumps({"window": params.get("window", "24h"), "reply": "ok"}))
```

```bash
# bash
params="$(cat)"
echo "{\"reply\": \"got $params\"}"
```

### stdout / stderr

- **stdout** — captured into a capped buffer (1 MB). Returned as `InvokeResult.Stdout`. Convention: handlers emit JSON; the caller decodes into whatever shape they expect.
- **stderr** — capped buffer (64 KB). Surfaced on failure for operator diagnostics.
- Non-zero exit codes are NOT errors from `Invoke`'s perspective — the integer is returned via `InvokeResult.ExitCode`. `err` is reserved for spawn failures (binary missing, permission denied).

### Timeout

`InvokeRequest.Timeout` bounds the subprocess lifetime. Zero → `InvokerConfig.DefaultTimeout` (30s). The timeout plumbs through the runner's context, so both the production `CmdBuilder` (uses `exec.CommandContext`) and test fakes respect it.

---

## Security model

**Access control sits in the sandbox, not the invoker.** Today's invoker pipes JSON into a subprocess under the inherited security context; the next layer — integration with `internal/sandbox` — wraps the runner in a per-invocation `sandbox.Policy` computed from the manifest:

1. **Base** — no network, no filesystem outside handler dir + the runtime interpreter's path, seccomp allowlist from `DefaultSeccompPolicy` (same as tools), namespaces (CLONE_NEWNET, CLONE_NEWUSER, etc.), NoNewPrivs.
2. **Manifest-declared storage** — each `storage: [{label, mode}]` entry resolves via `Manager.Resolve` and adds that absolute path to Landlock's `AllowedPaths` (with `ReadOnlyPaths` for `mode: read`). A skill declaring `storage: [{label: shared, mode: read}]` can `open(O_RDONLY)` anything under the resolved path and nothing else.
3. **Runtime executable** — `python3` / `bash` paths are added to the exec allowlist.
4. **Network** — declared `network: [host:port]` entries. No enforcement today; nftables or eBPF integration is a Phase 11 item.

**Raw paths are rejected in manifests.** Skill authors can't write `path: /etc/shadow` or `path: ../../secrets`. Labels only. An operator who wants a skill to read an arbitrary host path wires a `type: local` storage mount pointing there first — same Raft-replicated audit trail as every other mount.

See [SANDBOX.md](SANDBOX.md) for the sandbox internals.

**Sandbox integration (Phase 8b.2) is shipped.** `Invoker` builds a `sandbox.Policy` per invocation and passes it via `RunSpec.Policy`; the production `CmdBuilder.Run` wraps `cmd.Start` with `sandbox.Apply(cmd, policy)` so every skill subprocess runs under Landlock + seccomp + user-namespace isolation + NoNewPrivs. Test fakes receive the policy too, so "did we ask for read-only on this label?" becomes a direct assertion.

Composition rules:

| Source | Becomes |
|---|---|
| Always | `NoNewPrivs: true`, default seccomp, user + PID + IPC + UTS namespaces |
| Manifest dir | Read-only entry in `AllowedPaths` + `ReadOnlyPaths` |
| Runtime interpreter dir (e.g. `/usr/bin` for `/usr/bin/bash`) | Read-only entry |
| `/tmp` | Writable entry (scratch for bytecode caches, lockfiles, etc.) |
| Each manifest `storage` entry | `AllowedPaths` always; `ReadOnlyPaths` only when `mode: read` |

---

## Boot wiring

Scheduler and channels are the natural skill consumers. The node layer wires:

```
node.New (Raft branch)
 ├─ storage.Manager already up (Phase 9)
 ├─ skills.Registry(log)
 ├─ skills.Invoker(Registry, Storage)
 ├─ skills.AgentAdapter(Registry, Invoker)
 └─ later, inside wireCompute:
     compute.NewAgent(AgentConfig{..., Skills: adapter})
```

`Node.SkillRegistry()` exposes the registry so tests (and eventually a `skill install` CLI) can `Put` directly. Storage-mounted skills are picked up via `Registry.Watch(ctx, mgr, "skills")` — the node deliberately doesn't hard-code the mount label; operators configure a `[[storage.mounts]]` entry labelled `skills` and call `Registry.Watch` from their startup script (or future `lobslaw skill watch` subcommand).

### Agent ↔ skills wiring

The agent sees skills as if they were tools: when the LLM emits a `tool_call` whose `name` matches a registered skill, `compute.Agent.runToolCall` short-circuits the executor path and routes through `compute.SkillDispatcher` (backed by `skills.AgentAdapter`). The executor is consulted only when `Has(name)` returns false.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant LLM
  participant Agent as compute.Agent
  participant Skills as SkillDispatcher<br/>(skills.AgentAdapter)
  participant Exec as compute.Executor

  LLM->>Agent: tool_call{name, args}
  Agent->>Skills: Has(name)?
  alt known skill
    Skills-->>Agent: true
    Agent->>Skills: Invoke(name, params)
    Skills->>Skills: Registry.Get → Invoker.Invoke<br/>(build policy, spawn subprocess,<br/>sandbox.Apply, capture stdio)
    Skills-->>Agent: {exit_code, stdout, stderr}
  else unknown skill
    Skills-->>Agent: false
    Agent->>Exec: Invoke(name, params)
  end
  Agent-->>LLM: ToolInvocation{output, exit_code, error}
```

Budget accounting is shared: `RecordToolCall` fires for skill-routed calls too, and `RecordEgressBytes` counts `len(stdout) + len(stderr)`. A skill can't be a loophole around per-turn budgets.

Skill errors (missing storage label, sandbox install failure, invoker config error) surface as the `ToolInvocation.Error` field — same shape as executor errors, so the model sees a uniform "this call failed because X" message regardless of which path handled it.

---

## Manifest signing

Ed25519 detached signatures, operator-configurable policy. The config flag lives under `[skills]`:

```toml
[skills]
signing_policy      = "prefer"                    # off | prefer | require
trusted_publishers  = "/etc/lobslaw/publishers"   # file path
```

**Three-state policy, not a boolean.** Most community skills ship unsigned; requiring signatures would exclude them entirely, while ignoring signatures loses the safety benefit for skills that DO ship signed.

| Policy | Unsigned manifest | Signed (valid) | Signed (invalid / wrong key) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `off` | accepted, `IsSigned=false` | accepted, `IsSigned=false` (verification never runs) | accepted, `IsSigned=false` |
| `prefer` | accepted, `IsSigned=false` | accepted, `IsSigned=true`, `SignedBy=<key name>` | **rejected** (tamper signal) |
| `require` | **rejected** | accepted, `IsSigned=true` | **rejected** |

Under `prefer`, the registry's winner-selection uses IsSigned as a tiebreaker: when two candidates share a semver, the signed one wins. Higher semver still beats lower regardless — signing is only a tiebreaker, not an override.

### Publisher key format

`trusted_publishers` points at a text file:

```
# one publisher per line
lobslaw-core       Zq3N8X4rT2aQ8m4yL7e6vJh5CpR9wK1sX0fN3tB2uV4=
community-pack-a   5XbMvQ2tGh9rP3cL8kN7wA1eF6yB4sZ0uK2dJ5nT8=
```

Format is deliberately minimal — no TOML nesting, no JSON schema — because trust roots should be human-auditable at a glance. Blank lines and `#` comments are supported.

### Signing the manifest

Publishers use any ed25519 tool (`signify`, `minisign --raw`, `openssl pkeyutl`) to sign `manifest.yaml` and drop the result next to it as `manifest.yaml.sig`. Both raw-binary and base64-encoded signature files are accepted so editors and CI pipelines don't need to agree on a format.

Example with openssl:
```bash
openssl pkeyutl -sign -inkey privkey.pem -rawin -in manifest.yaml > manifest.yaml.sig
```

## RTK integration

RTK (Rust Token Killer) compresses tool output and decorates prompts to cut token cost on routine dev operations. Because it already speaks the Claude-Code hook protocol (JSON request on stdin, JSON response on stdout) and lobslaw adopted that same protocol in `internal/hooks`, no RTK-specific Go code is needed — it's a pure-config integration.

Drop the entries from `examples/hooks.rtk.toml` into your `config.toml` and restart the node. RTK fires on every `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` event, runs outside the tool's sandbox (it's a hook, not a tool), and returns its decision in the usual hook response shape.

Short timeouts are intentional: a stuck RTK shouldn't block tool dispatch. The hooks dispatcher treats a timed-out hook as approve-through so a mis-installed RTK can't wedge the agent.
